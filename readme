This project alongside all other iOS dev is sadly on hold. My development device, an old iPhone 6S, automatically updated to an unjailbreak-able firmware. So I'm unable to
use it to code and develop iOS tweaks. I'm currently looking into purchasing a Mac Mini or building a Hackintosh, or simply waiting for a jailbreak to release so I can resume
development!
