Jailbreak tweak development is now live! I've managed to jailbreak my old iPhone 6S via Odyssey on iOS 13.7. 
I should be able to develop tweaks as that's been my passion for years now.
I sadly STILL don't have a Mac/Apple device to code on so I'm trying to code on the phone itself, or through WSL through Ubuntu.
I'm starting off with NoDock, which is my first tweak! I'll be learning Obj-C as I go along and developing more complex tweaks.

Open any pull requests for issues OR DM on Twitter @dhaliwalgurj.
